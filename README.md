# Vanilla JS Scrollify

A vanilla JS module to assist in scroll snapping. Inspired by LukeHaas's [jQuery Scrollify](http://projects.lukehaas.me/scrollify). Not yet touch optimized.
This project is a work in progress. Currently only basic behavior is supported.

## Basic Setup

Vanilla Scrollify depends on [`smooth-scroll-module`](https://github.com/ianbusko/smooth-scroll-module).

Use the module like this:

```javascript
var scrollMod = new Scrollify({
  section: '.section'
});
```
